      <span class="secondary left full top">3 min read / posted 07/05/2024</span>
      <p class="light left">
        Hey, welcome to dris LLC! Glad you could join us here. I'm <a href="https://dris.one" target="_blank" class="underlined">Dris</a>, and our
        journey has been one of persistence and entrepreneurial spirit. From my early days of selling toys in kindergarten to founding a creative
        agency, our path has been fairly unconventional.
      </p>

      <p class="light left">
        It's hard to say exactly where it all started. I've probably done every side-hustle you could think of, but I knew that I was always
        interested in marketing and business. One of my first ventures was an online storefront for some of my drawings. I never ended up making any
        sales, but I'm pretty sure I had my first website on the internet before I could tell the time.
      </p>

      <p class="light left">
        It got more serious in the summer before 6th grade when I taught myself to code. This led to the creation of my first startup, lemonAYD, an
        app where students could raise funds for their school or community through lemonade stands and digital payment processing. lemonAYD won the
        Congressional App Challenge later that year, making me one of its youngest recipients ever. But that was just the tip of the iceberg.
      </p>

      <p class="light left">
        dris LLC officially started on October 16th, 2022 as an e-commerce company, leveraging a custom-trained AI model to identify winning
        dropshipping products consistently. With the introduction of GPT 3.0, I took it a step further, automating Shopify store creation with
        custom-built templates while maintaining a personal touch in branding and design (I always thought I was better at naming).
      </p>

      <p class="light left full underlined">turning point</p>

      <p class="light left">
        It wasn't without challenges. After a pretty slow start in e-commerce, I participated in a school hackathon and came in 3rd place, earning
        $750—more in two days than in two months of online sales. I questioned if it was even worth continuing dris LLC. However, I decided I just
        needed to change my approach.
      </p>

      <p class="light left">
        Drawing from my experience starting a YouTube channel that amassed nearly 200K subscribers and 160M views in just 9 months, I completely
        changed our marketing strategy. We leveraged social media and focused on creating compelling narratives around our products, combining
        professional editing and production with data-driven iteration.
      </p>

      <p class="light left">
        The results were transformative. First 50k views. Then 500k. Then millions. Within two weeks, our videos began consistently reaching hundreds
        of thousands of views, and at its peak, a single store generated $50K in monthly revenue—all from a $60 investment and hundreds of hours
        poured in. This success fueled our expansion into other ventures.
      </p>

      <p class="light left full underlined">the sky's the limit</p>

      <p class="light left">
        Innovation later led to the creation of <a href="https://sparkhs.org" target="_blank" class="underlined">SparkHS</a>, an initiative designed
        to nurture the next generation of programmers, business leaders, and designers. This project embodies both my passions and dris LLC's
        commitment to learning and future-focused thinking.
      </p>

      <p class="light left">
        After months of freelance web design under dris LLC, in January of 2024, I founded a new startup,
        <a href="https://trysmartpark.com" target="_blank" class="underlined">SmartPark</a>, an app created to revolutionize parking solutions. It's a
        testament to our ability to identify market needs and create impactful solutions. While working on SmartPark, I assembled our team of young
        designers, developers, creators, and entrepreneurs, and I'm incredibly grateful for their work and dedication since.
      </p>
